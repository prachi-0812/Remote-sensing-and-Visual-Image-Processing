Using Google Earth Engine, visualised different spectral indices of various places and analysed it at different time series and predict the weather and land features of the area
Here, we have used NDBI index for analysing. Similarly, we could other spectral index by just chnaging formula and obtain the various layers and time series graphs.
Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) is a spectral index used to analyze built-up areas. This index uses two bands: the short-wave infrared (SWIR) and the near-infrared (NIR). Areas with more built-up structures reflect shortwave-infrared (SWIR) more while areas with less built-up have a low Near-Infrared (NIR) reflectance.
